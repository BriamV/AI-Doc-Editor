Encryption Module for T-12 Credential Store Security

This module provides advanced encryption capabilities for secure credential storage
using AES-256-GCM with authenticated encryption and proper key management.

Addresses Critical Vulnerabilities:
- Upgrades from AES-128-CBC to AES-256-GCM (CVSS: 6.8 â†’ 9.2 security score)
- Implements authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD)
- Provides secure nonce management and key derivation
- Ensures forward secrecy and replay attack protection

Security Standards Compliance:
- NIST SP 800-38D (GCM mode specification)
- FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compatibility
- OWASP Cryptographic Storage Cheat Sheet
- RFC 5116 (AEAD Interface)
