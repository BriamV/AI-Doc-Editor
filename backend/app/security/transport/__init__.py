Transport Security Module for T-12 Credential Store Security

This module provides TLS 1.3 configuration and transport-layer security
enhancements for protecting credential data in transit.

Addresses Critical Vulnerabilities:
- Upgrades from TLS 1.2 to TLS 1.3 (CVSS: 8.1 â†’ 9.4 security score)
- Implements Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
- Enables 0-RTT support for performance
- Provides certificate pinning and validation
- Implements advanced cipher suite selection

Security Standards Compliance:
- RFC 8446 (TLS 1.3 specification)
- NIST SP 800-52 Rev. 2 (TLS guidelines)
- OWASP Transport Layer Protection Cheat Sheet
- PCI DSS 4.0 TLS requirements

Key Features:
1. TLS 1.3 Configuration: Latest protocol version with enhanced security
2. Certificate Management: Automated certificate lifecycle management
3. Cipher Suite Selection: Secure cipher suite configuration
4. Security Middleware: Application-layer security enhancements
