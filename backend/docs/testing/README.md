## Quick Reference

### Current Testing Status
- **Frontend Tests**: 37 Jest tests ✅ **PASSING**
- **Backend Tests**: 322 pytest tests (187 passing, with integration issues)
- **Integration Tests**: Experiencing configuration and mock-related failures
- **Quality Gate**: Passing except for acceptable complexity in security code

### Running Full Security Suites

Most backend and security suites are now opt-in to keep daily CI runs fast. Set `ENABLE_FULL_SECURITY_TESTS=1` and `ENABLE_T12_TESTS=1` before invoking pytest when you need the full security/enterprise coverage. Example:

```bash
ENABLE_FULL_SECURITY_TESTS=1 ENABLE_T12_TESTS=1 pytest backend/tests --tb=short -q
```

On PowerShell use:

```powershell
$env:ENABLE_FULL_SECURITY_TESTS = "1"; $env:ENABLE_T12_TESTS = "1"; pytest backend/tests --tb=short -q
```

Expect the previously skipped long-running integration suites to execute; unresolved failures from those paths will resurface until the underlying issues are addressed.

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. TLSSecurityMiddleware Mock Configuration
**Error**: `'TLSSecurityMiddleware' object has no attribute 'tls_config'`
**Impact**: Multiple integration test failures
**Priority**: CRITICAL

#### 2. Database Session Management
**Issue**: Session lifecycle and cleanup problems
**Impact**: Test isolation and connection leaks
**Priority**: HIGH

#### 3. HSM Mock Integration
**Issue**: Inconsistent mock configurations across test suites
**Impact**: Integration test reliability
**Priority**: MEDIUM

./scripts/weekly_test_performance.py

# Coverage Analysis
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

### 3. Mock Validation
```bash
# Validate all mock interfaces
python -m pytest tests/validation/test_mock_compliance.py

# Check mock configuration consistency
./scripts/validate_mock_configs.sh
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Commit Validation
```bash
# Automated checks before code commit
./scripts/pre_commit_test_validation.sh
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow integration
- name: Enhanced Test Validation
  run: |
    python -m pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-fail-under=85
    ./scripts/validate_test_health.sh
    ./scripts/check_performance_regression.sh
```

### Development Guidelines

#### When Adding New Tests
1. Follow mock configuration standards (MOCK_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md)
2. Ensure proper test isolation (TEST_ISOLATION_AND_COVERAGE_RECOMMENDATIONS.md)
3. Add both success and failure scenarios
4. Include performance considerations
5. Update documentation as needed

#### When Modifying Components
1. Update corresponding mock interfaces
2. Validate test coverage impact
3. Run component-specific test suites
4. Check integration test compatibility
5. Update mock configuration if interfaces changed

## Team Responsibilities

### Development Team
- **Daily**: Run health checks before development
- **Per PR**: Validate test coverage and performance
- **Weekly**: Review test metrics and address issues

### QA Team
- **Daily**: Monitor test execution and failures
- **Weekly**: Comprehensive test suite validation
- **Monthly**: Test strategy and coverage review

### Security Team
- **Weekly**: Security test scenario validation
- **Monthly**: Security coverage assessment
- **Quarterly**: Security test strategy review
