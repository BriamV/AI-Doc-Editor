# Security Code Complexity Management Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides specific guidelines for managing complexity in security-critical code, establishing clear principles for when higher complexity is justified and how to maintain security effectiveness while managing technical debt.

## Security vs. Maintainability Framework

### Decision Matrix

When evaluating whether to accept or reduce complexity in security functions, use this framework:

| Security Impact | Complexity Level | Decision | Action Required |
|----------------|------------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Critical** | CC ≤ 20 | ✅ **Accept** | Document justification |
| **Critical** | CC > 20 | ⚠️ **Review** | Security architect approval |
| **High** | CC ≤ 15 | ✅ **Accept** | Standard review |
| **High** | CC > 15 | ⚠️ **Optimize** | Refactor if possible |
| **Medium** | CC ≤ 10 | ✅ **Accept** | Standard guidelines |
| **Medium** | CC > 10 | ❌ **Refactor** | Must be simplified |
| **Low** | CC > 8 | ❌ **Refactor** | Standard complexity rules |

### Security Impact Classification

#### Critical Security Functions
- **Authentication/Authorization**: User identity and access control
- **Cryptographic Operations**: Encryption, key management, signatures
- **Certificate Validation**: PKI, TLS, trust chains
- **Input Validation**: SQL injection, XSS prevention
- **Audit/Monitoring**: Security event detection and logging

#### High Security Functions
- **Security Configuration**: System security settings
- **Rate Limiting**: DoS protection mechanisms
- **Session Management**: User session handling
- **Data Sanitization**: Output encoding and filtering

#### Medium Security Functions
- **Security Reporting**: Dashboard and metrics
- **Configuration Validation**: Security policy checking
- **Resource Management**: Security-related resource allocation

#### Low Security Functions
- **UI Security Features**: Display security indicators
- **Security Documentation**: Help and guidance features
- **Performance Monitoring**: Security performance metrics

## Complexity Justification Categories

### 1. Algorithmic Complexity (Acceptable)

**Examples from T-12**:
- **Risk Scoring Algorithms**: Multiple weighted factors require complex calculations
- **Pattern Detection**: Security anomaly detection needs sophisticated logic
- **Cryptographic Validation**: Algorithm-specific parameter checking

**Justification**: Mathematical complexity is inherent to security algorithms and cannot be simplified without losing effectiveness.

### 2. Validation Complexity (Acceptable)

**Examples from T-12**:
- **Certificate Chain Validation**: Multiple validation steps required by PKI standards
- **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive checking prevents injection attacks
- **Policy Enforcement**: Multiple rule evaluation required for compliance

**Justification**: Security requires comprehensive validation that naturally increases complexity.

### 3. Error Handling Complexity (Acceptable)

**Examples from T-12**:
- **Secure Failure Modes**: Different error responses for different attack types
- **Audit Trail Generation**: Detailed logging for security events
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintaining security during partial failures

**Justification**: Proper security error handling requires sophisticated logic to prevent information leakage.

### 4. Configuration Complexity (Reviewable)

**Examples from T-12**:
- **Multi-Environment Settings**: Different security configs per environment
- **Feature Toggles**: Security feature enablement logic
- **Compatibility Modes**: Legacy system integration

**Justification**: May be simplified through better configuration management without impacting security.

### 5. Business Logic Complexity (Should Reduce)

**Examples to Avoid**:
- **Multiple Business Rules**: Unrelated business logic in security functions
- **UI Logic**: Presentation logic mixed with security logic
- **Data Transformation**: Non-security data processing

**Justification**: Not security-related complexity and should be refactored.

## Implementation Guidelines

### For High-Complexity Security Functions (CC > 15)

#### Required Documentation
```python
def validate_certificate_chain(certificates: List[x509.Certificate]) -> Tuple[bool, List[str]]:
    """
    Validate X.509 certificate chain according to RFC 5280.

    COMPLEXITY JUSTIFICATION (CC: 16):
    - Trust chain validation: RFC 5280 requires multiple validation steps
    - Revocation checking: CRL and OCSP validation per certificate
    - Time validity: NotBefore/NotAfter validation with clock skew tolerance
    - Key usage validation: Certificate purpose verification per RFC requirements
    - Policy constraints: Certificate policy checking for compliance

    SECURITY CRITICALITY: Critical - Forms foundation of PKI security
    REFACTORING RISK: High - Breaking function could introduce security gaps
    """
```

#### Required Testing
- **Branch Coverage**: 100% for security functions
- **Security Test Cases**: Specific attack scenario testing
- **Edge Case Testing**: Malformed input, boundary conditions
- **Performance Testing**: Timing attack prevention validation

#### Code Review Requirements
- **Security Specialist**: Required for functions CC > 15
- **Security Impact Assessment**: Document potential vulnerabilities
- **Threat Model Review**: Verify attack surface coverage

### For Medium-Complexity Security Functions (CC 11-15)

#### Simplified Documentation
```python
def analyze_access_pattern(event: CredentialAccessEvent) -> Tuple[int, AccessPattern]:
    """
    Analyze credential access patterns for suspicious activity.

    COMPLEXITY: CC 19 - Multiple security pattern detection algorithms
    SECURITY: Critical - Credential access monitoring and anomaly detection
    """
```

#### Testing Requirements
- **Branch Coverage**: >95%
- **Security Test Cases**: Core attack scenarios
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end security flow validation

### Helper Function Strategy

Instead of reducing complexity in security functions, create security-focused helper functions:

```python
# GOOD: Security-specific helpers that maintain context
class CertificateValidator:
    def _check_validity_period(self, cert: x509.Certificate) -> bool:
        """Check certificate time validity with security considerations."""

    def _validate_key_usage(self, cert: x509.Certificate, usage: str) -> bool:
        """Validate certificate key usage for security purposes."""

    def _check_revocation_status(self, cert: x509.Certificate) -> bool:
        """Check certificate revocation status via CRL/OCSP."""

# AVOID: Generic helpers that lose security context
def check_time_range(start: datetime, end: datetime, current: datetime) -> bool:
    """Generic time checking - loses security context."""
```

## Quality Gate Configuration

### Recommended radon Configuration

```ini
# .radon.cfg
[tool:radon]
exclude = */migrations/*,*/tests/*
ignore = .venv,__pycache__

[tool:radon.cc]
# Standard modules
min = C
max = B
show_complexity = true
average = true

# Security modules - separate configuration
[tool:radon.security]
paths = app/security/
min = D  # Allow higher complexity
max = C  # Flag for review at D level
show_complexity = true
average = true
```

### pyproject.toml Integration

```toml
[tool.security-complexity]
security_modules = [
    "app/security/",
    "app/auth/",
    "app/encryption/"
]

complexity_thresholds = {
    security_modules = 20,
    general_modules = 10,
    documentation_required = 15
}

[tool.quality-gates]
# Security functions exempt from standard complexity rules
security_complexity_override = true
security_threshold = 20
require_security_justification = true
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Complexity Trend Monitoring

```python
# Example monitoring script
def monitor_security_complexity():
    """Monitor complexity trends in security modules."""

    security_modules = get_security_modules()
    for module in security_modules:
        current_complexity = calculate_complexity(module)
        historical_complexity = get_historical_complexity(module)

        if current_complexity > historical_complexity * 1.2:
            alert_complexity_increase(module, current_complexity)

        if current_complexity > 25:  # Critical threshold
            alert_critical_complexity(module, current_complexity)
```

### Automated Documentation

```python
def generate_complexity_justification(function_name: str, complexity: int):
    """Auto-generate complexity justification template."""

    if complexity > 15:
        return f"""
        COMPLEXITY JUSTIFICATION (CC: {complexity}):
        - [ ] Algorithmic complexity (security algorithms)
        - [ ] Validation complexity (input/certificate/policy validation)
        - [ ] Error handling complexity (secure failure modes)
        - [ ] Configuration complexity (multi-environment security)
        - [ ] Other: _______________

        SECURITY CRITICALITY: [ ] Critical [ ] High [ ] Medium [ ] Low
        REFACTORING RISK: [ ] High [ ] Medium [ ] Low
        """
```
