tools/validate-dod.sh T-XX           # Use /review-complete instead
tools/qa-workflow.sh T-XX action     # Use workflow slash commands instead
```

### **Tier 2: Slash Commands** (Preferred User Interface)
```bash
# Primary workflow commands leveraging tools infrastructure
/task-dev T-XX [complete]            # Task development using task-navigator + extract-subtasks
/context-analyze [--depth]           # Project analysis via progress-dashboard + task-data-parser
/review-complete [--scope]           # Validation using validate-dod + qa-workflow
/docs-update [scope]                 # Documentation updates via traceability-manager
/commit-smart                        # Smart commits with status-updater integration
```
