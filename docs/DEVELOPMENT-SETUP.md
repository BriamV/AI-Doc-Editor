# Development Setup & Pre-Development Checklist

**Purpose**: Complete verification and setup checklist before starting development on the AI-Doc-Editor evolution project.

---

## Pre-Development Checklist

### ✅ Technical Baseline Verification

- [ ] **Current Project State**: Verify base repository actually runs
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
  # Verify application loads at http://localhost:5173
  ```

- [ ] **Technology Stack Audit**: Confirm current dependencies vs target architecture
  - [ ] Review `package.json` for React 18, TypeScript, Vite configuration
  - [ ] Check current UI framework (likely TailwindCSS)
  - [ ] Identify current state management (Zustand expected)
  - [ ] Verify Monaco Editor integration

- [ ] **Environment Requirements**: Check if additional tools needed for backend evolution
  - [ ] Python 3.11+ for FastAPI backend (per PRD target)
  - [ ] Docker for containerization (per WORK-PLAN T-01)
  - [ ] Node.js version compatibility
  - [ ] Git configuration and SSH keys

- [ ] **API Dependencies**: Understand OpenAI API key management
  - [ ] Current implementation of API key storage
  - [ ] Encryption/security model in base repository
  - [ ] Target implementation per SEC-002 requirements

### ✅ Development Setup

- [ ] **Git Workflow**: Review CONTRIBUTING.md for branch naming and PR process
  - [ ] Understand feature branch naming convention (`feature/T<XX>-name`)
  - [ ] Review commit message format requirements
  - [ ] Verify Git Flow compatibility

- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: Identify current test framework and coverage
  - [ ] Check for existing test files (Jest, Cypress, etc.)
  - [ ] Review test coverage requirements
  - [ ] Understand testing expectations per DESIGN_GUIDELINES

- [ ] **Build Pipeline**: Understand current CI/CD vs target (T-01 in WORK-PLAN)
  - [ ] Review existing GitHub Actions or CI configuration
  - [ ] Understand quality gates and linting requirements
  - [ ] Check Docker build process if exists

- [ ] **Code Quality Gates**: Check existing linting/formatting vs DESIGN_GUIDELINES
  - [ ] ESLint configuration and rules
  - [ ] Prettier formatting setup
  - [ ] TypeScript strict mode configuration
  - [ ] Import/export conventions

### ✅ Execution Strategy

- [ ] **First Task Identification**: Determine actual starting point from WORK-PLAN v5.md
  - [ ] Review R0.WP1 tasks (likely T-01: Baseline & CI/CD)
  - [ ] Understand task dependencies and prerequisites
  - [ ] Confirm task complexity and time estimates

- [ ] **Definition of Done**: Establish clear completion criteria for each task
  - [ ] Review acceptance criteria format in WORK-PLAN
  - [ ] Understand evidence/artifacts requirements
  - [ ] Verify testing and quality requirements

- [ ] **Progress Tracking**: Set up TodoWrite workflow for task management
  - [ ] Initialize project todos using TodoWrite tool
  - [ ] Establish task status workflow (pending → in_progress → completed)
  - [ ] Set up regular progress reporting mechanism

- [ ] **Risk Mitigation**: Identify immediate blockers
  - [ ] API key availability and configuration
  - [ ] Environment compatibility issues
  - [ ] Dependency conflicts or version mismatches
  - [ ] Access to required external services

### ✅ Context Validation

- [ ] **Gap Analysis Verification**: Validate ARCH-GAP-ANALYSIS findings against actual codebase
  - [ ] Confirm 65% coverage estimate is accurate
  - [ ] Verify identified 11 functional gaps
  - [ ] Validate 9 NFR gaps listed
  - [ ] Check technology stack assumptions

- [ ] **Requirements Traceability**: Ensure PRD requirements map to implementation plan
  - [ ] Cross-reference PRD v2.md requirements with WORK-PLAN tasks
  - [ ] Verify all 44 functional requirements are covered
  - [ ] Confirm 16 KPIs are implementable
  - [ ] Check roadmap R0-R6 feasibility

- [ ] **User Feedback Loop**: Establish mechanism for progress reporting and direction changes
  - [ ] Define reporting frequency and format
  - [ ] Establish escalation process for blockers
  - [ ] Set up communication channels for updates

## Environment Setup Commands

### Base Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup base repository
cd /mnt/d/DELL_/Documents/GitHub/AI-Doc-Editor
npm install
npm run dev

# Verify Electron build (if needed)
npm run electron

# Check for any existing tests
npm test # (if test script exists)
```

### Development Tools Verification
```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Check npm version  
npm --version

# Check Git configuration
git config --list

# Verify Docker (if needed for backend evolution)
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

### Code Quality Tools
```bash
# Check linting setup
npm run lint # (if script exists)

# Check formatting
npm run format # (if script exists)

# TypeScript compilation check
npm run build
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **Ready to Start Development** when:
- [ ] All checklist items completed
- [ ] Base repository runs without errors
- [ ] Development environment fully configured
- [ ] First task (likely T-01) clearly understood
- [ ] TodoWrite workflow initialized with project tasks
- [ ] No critical blockers identified

---

## Notes

- This checklist should be executed once before beginning development
- Individual task setup may require additional verification steps
- Update this document if new setup requirements are discovered
- Use TodoWrite tool to track completion of checklist items during execution
