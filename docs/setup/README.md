## Bridge to Implementation

### Backend Implementation
- Original backend documentation: `backend/docs/` (preserved for implementation reference)
- Testing implementation: `backend/tests/` (with setup guides in this documentation)

### Tools and Scripts
- Tools implementation: `tools/` directory (with overview documentation here)
- Scripts implementation: `scripts/` directory (with overview documentation here)

**Note**: This documentation consolidates setup information from various locations throughout the repository. Original implementation files remain in their respective directories (`backend/`, `tools/`, `scripts/`) while documentation is centralized here for better organization.
