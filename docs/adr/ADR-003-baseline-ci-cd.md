# ADR-003: Baseline CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Per WORK-PLAN v5 task T-01, we need to establish a robust CI/CD pipeline with quality gates for the AI-Doc-Editor project. The current codebase lacks automated testing, linting, and continuous integration.

Current challenges:
- No automated testing framework
- No code quality gates
- No CI/CD pipeline
- Legacy codebase with ~11k formatting issues
- Need to support multiple Node.js versions

## Decision
Implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions with the following components:

### Core Pipeline (`ci.yml`):
- **Multi-Node Support**: Test on Node 18.x and 20.x
- **Quality Gates**: TypeScript check, ESLint, Prettier, tests
- **Coverage**: Jest coverage reports with Codecov integration
- **Build Validation**: Ensure application builds successfully
- **E2E Testing**: Cypress tests on Node 20.x only

### PR Validation (`pr-validation.yml`):
- **Title Format**: Enforce `feat(T-XX): description` convention
- **Size Labeling**: Automatic PR size classification (XS-XL)
- **Security Scanning**: npm audit + Semgrep integration

### Quality Thresholds:
- ESLint: Max 0 warnings (`--max-warnings 0`)
- Test Coverage: Generate reports (no threshold initially)
- TypeScript: Strict compilation required
- PR Title: Must follow task-based convention

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Automated quality enforcement prevents regression
- Consistent code formatting across codebase
- Multi-environment validation (Node 18/20)
- Security vulnerability detection
- Coverage tracking and improvement visibility
- Task traceability through PR titles

### Challenges:
- Initial setup requires fixing ~11k linting issues in legacy code
- Additional CI time (~5-10 minutes per PR)
- Learning curve for task-based PR title convention
- Complexity analysis tools deferred due to dependency conflicts

### Risks Mitigated:
- Code quality regression
- Breaking changes in different Node versions
- Security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Loss of task traceability

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Jenkins Pipeline**: More complex setup, requires infrastructure
2. **GitLab CI**: Not applicable (using GitHub)
3. **No CI/CD**: Unacceptable for production-grade development
4. **Simpler Pipeline**: Would not meet T-01 quality gate requirements

## Related Decisions
- **PRD v2.md**: Quality and testing requirements
- **WORK-PLAN v5.md**: Task T-01 acceptance criteria
- **DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md**: Code quality standards
- **ADR-005**: Pydantic v2 adoption (supports performance benchmarking)

## Implementation Notes
- Docker integration deferred until WSL2 Docker installation
- Complexity analysis tools deferred due to TypeScript version conflicts
- E2E tests run only on Node 20.x to optimize CI time
- Coverage uploads only on Node 20.x to avoid duplicates
