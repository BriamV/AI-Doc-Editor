## 🚨 Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **HSM Integration Complexity**: May require additional vendor coordination
   - **Mitigation**: Start HSM integration early, have software fallback
   - **Timeline Impact**: Potential 2-3 day delay

2. **Database Migration**: Large credential sets may require extended downtime
   - **Mitigation**: Implement streaming migration with rollback capability
   - **Timeline Impact**: May extend Week 4 by 1-2 days

3. **Performance Impact**: New encryption may affect response times
   - **Mitigation**: Continuous performance monitoring and optimization
   - **Timeline Impact**: Ongoing optimization throughout implementation

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Third-party Dependencies**: New cryptographic libraries
2. **Certificate Management**: Automated processes may need fine-tuning
3. **Integration Testing**: Complex interactions between new components
