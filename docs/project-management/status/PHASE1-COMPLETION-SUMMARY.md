- **Batch Generator:** `tools/batch-task-generator.sh` (controlled generation)
- **Sync System:** `tools/sync-systems.sh` (bidirectional synchronization)
- **Migration Validator:** `tools/migration-validator.sh` (integrity testing)
- **Traceability Manager:** `tools/traceability-manager.sh` (audit trails)

## Data Preservation Verification

### ✅ Preserved Elements
- **All Task Metadata:** ID, title, status, dependencies, priority, release target
- **Technical Details:** Stack info, libraries, linters, quality analysis
- **Test Strategy:** Unit tests, integration tests, performance tests

- **Definition of Done:** Full DoD checklists
- **WII Subtasks:** All 200+ subtasks with complete structure (R<#>.WP<#>-T<XX>-ST<#>)
- **Cross-References:** ADR references, task dependencies, template links
- **Completion Status:** Checkmarks, percentages, progress indicators

### 🔄 Sync Metadata Added
- **Source Traceability:** Original file references
- **Extraction Timestamps:** Generation dates
- **Checksums:** Data integrity verification
- **Migration Phase:** Phase tracking
- **Validator Information:** Tool versioning

## System Validation Results
