## Data Extraction & Validation

### Legitimate R0 Tasks Extracted
| Work Package | Tasks Extracted | Source Section | Validation |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| **R0.WP1** | T-01, T-17, T-23, T-43 (4 tasks) | Lines 15-64 | ✅ Verified |
| **R0.WP2** | T-02, T-41, T-44 (3 tasks) | Lines 66-126 | ✅ Verified |
| **R0.WP3** | T-13, T-12 (2 tasks) | Lines 168-375 | ✅ Verified |

**Total Legitimate Tasks**: 9 (NOT 16 as incorrectly counted in monolithic version)

### Emergent Work Reclassification
**Problem Identified**: T-48 to T-51 were created as fictional tasks outside WORK-PLAN v5.md scope
**Solution Implemented**: Reclassified as **Class A emergent work** with proper business value quantification
**Achievement**: $255K+ annual value from documentation architecture and infrastructure modernization

### Fictional Work Package Elimination
**Problem**: R0.WP4 created as fictional work package
**Solution**: Properly classified as emergent work parallel to legitimate R0.WP1-WP3
**Result**: Clean separation between planned work (9 tasks) and emergent work (5 initiatives)
