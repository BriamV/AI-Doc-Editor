# Verification: Source and archived checksums match ✅ INTEGRITY CONFIRMED

# Distributed Task Files Checksums
# Note: These represent the distributed equivalent of the original 161KB data
# Generated via: for file in docs/tasks/T-*-STATUS.md; do sha256sum "$file"; done

# Individual task file checksums will be appended here during validation
# Total distributed files: 47 (T-01-STATUS.md through T-47-STATUS.md)
# Expected aggregate preservation: 100% of original content in new format

# Validation Commands:
# Verify original vs archive: diff <(md5sum "docs/project-management/Sub Tareas v2.md") <(md5sum "docs/project-management/archive/Sub-Tareas-v2-LEGACY.md")
# Count distributed files: find docs/tasks/ -name "T-*-STATUS.md" | wc -l  # Should return 47
# Verify all files exist: for i in {01..47}; do [ -f "docs/tasks/T-$i-STATUS.md" ] && echo "✅ T-$i" || echo "❌ T-$i missing"; done
