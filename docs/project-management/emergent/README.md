# Emergent Work Navigation

## Overview
This directory contains documentation for unplanned work that emerged during project execution. Emergent work is classified by risk level and business impact to ensure proper resource allocation and stakeholder communication.

## Emergent Work Classification

### Classification Framework
| Class | Priority | Description | Examples |
|-------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Class A** | Critical | Risk mitigation, architectural violations | Conway's Law violations, security gaps |
| **Class B** | High | Performance optimization, tool improvement | Workflow enhancement, process automation |
| **Class C** | Medium | Quality improvement, standardization | Documentation cleanup, code refactoring |
| **Class D** | Low | Nice-to-have, future consideration | UI polish, minor feature requests |

### Risk-Based Resource Allocation
- **Class A**: Immediate execution required, parallel to planned work
- **Class B**: Scheduled within current release cycle
- **Class C**: Planned for next available capacity
- **Class D**: Deferred to future releases or maintenance windows

## Completed Emergent Work
