### deprecated/
Contains legacy command files that have been superseded or are no longer in use:

- `intelligent-qa.md` - Legacy intelligent QA system (superseded by modern workflow)

- `README.md` - Legacy documentation
- `task-lifecycle.md` - Legacy task lifecycle management (replaced by task-dev workflow)

## Archive Policy

Files are moved to archive when they:
1. Are historical reports or phase documentation that clutter active commands
2. Represent deprecated functionality that has been replaced
3. Are no longer relevant to current development workflow
4. Need to be preserved for reference but shouldn't appear in active command listings

## Accessing Archived Content

While archived, these files remain accessible:
- Historical reports provide project development context
- Deprecated commands may contain implementation patterns useful for reference
- All content is searchable and can be referenced when needed

## Restoration

If archived content becomes relevant again:
1. Move the file back to the appropriate active directory
2. Update the main README.md to include the restored command
3. Ensure the command follows current naming and structural conventions
4. Test the command functionality before making it available
