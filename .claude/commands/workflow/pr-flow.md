# Pull Request Flow - Sub-Agent Delegation

---
description: Create PRs with proper code review delegation using Claude Code sub-agent best practices  
argument-hint: "[target-branch] [--draft]"
sub-agent: workflow-architect
---

## Purpose

Create pull requests with automated code review and security validation through explicit sub-agent delegation.

## Usage

```bash
/pr-flow                        # Auto-detect target from branch
/pr-flow develop                # Explicit target branch  
/pr-flow --draft                # Create draft PR
```

## Implementation

```bash
# Context detection and branch analysis
TARGET_BRANCH="${ARGUMENTS[0]}"
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null)
DRAFT_FLAG=""

# Handle draft flag
for arg in "$@"; do
    [ "$arg" = "--draft" ] && DRAFT_FLAG="--draft"
done

# Auto-detect target branch from GitFlow convention
[ -z "$TARGET_BRANCH" ] && {
    case "$CURRENT_BRANCH" in
        feature/*) TARGET_BRANCH="develop" ;;
        release/*) TARGET_BRANCH="main" ;;
        hotfix/*) TARGET_BRANCH="main" ;;
        *) TARGET_BRANCH="develop" ;;
    esac
}
