# DEPRECATED: Document validation has been integrated into ci.yml and pr-validation.yml workflows
# This file is kept for reference and will be removed in a future update.
#
# Document validation is now handled by:
# - ci.yml: unified-quality-metrics job includes docs:validate:strict
# - pr-validation.yml: docs-validation job provides comprehensive documentation validation
#
# Migration completed as part of workflow optimization to achieve frontend/backend parity
# and eliminate redundancy in GitHub Actions pipelines.
