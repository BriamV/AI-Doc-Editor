# QA System Cleanup Report

**Date:** July 8, 2025  
**Status:** Completed  

## Overview

Complete cleanup of the failed qa-hybrid system implementation to prepare for the new QA system based on WorkPlan QA CLI.md and PRD-QA CLI.md.

## What Was Removed

### 1. Directory Structure Eliminated

├── migrate-to-base-dimension.cjs
└── qa.cjs
```

### 2. CLI Integration Cleaned
- Removed reference to `../qa-hybrid/qa.cjs` in `scripts/cli.cjs:317`
- Removed `qa-hybrid/qa.cjs` from allowed special files list in `scripts/cli.cjs:381`
- Updated QA command to point to standard `qa.cjs` in commands directory

### 3. Dependencies Analyzed
- **No package.json dependencies removed**: The qa-hybrid system used only built-in Node.js modules and existing project dependencies
- **No new dependencies were added**: The system was self-contained

## Dependencies That Were Being Used (For Reference)

The qa-hybrid system was using these existing dependencies:
- Node.js built-in modules (fs, path, child_process)
- Existing project utilities (logger.cjs, config.cjs, etc.)
- Git CLI (external dependency)
- Various linting/testing tools already in the project

## New Implementation Ready

### Created
- `scripts/commands/qa.cjs` - New placeholder implementation aligned with WorkPlan
- Proper CLI integration maintained
- Help system implemented showing next steps

### Next Steps for New Implementation
According to WorkPlan QA CLI.md, the development should follow this sequence:

**Release 0.1.0 - MVP & Core (4 weeks)**
- **R0.WP1** (30 pts): T-01 (Baseline & CI/CD), T-02 (CLI Core), T-05 (Visual Logger), T-19 (QAConfig)
- **R0.WP2** (29 pts): T-03 (Context Detector), T-04 (Orchestrator), T-20 (Plan Selector)
- **R0.WP3** (28 pts): T-21 (Wrapper Coordinator), T-06 (MegaLinter), T-07 (Fast Mode), T-10 (Environment Checker)

## Files Modified
1. `scripts/cli.cjs` - Updated QA command mapping and removed qa-hybrid references
2. `scripts/commands/qa.cjs` - Created new implementation placeholder

## Files Removed
- Complete `scripts/qa-hybrid/` directory (approximately 50+ files)

## Validation
- ✅ `yarn run cmd qa` now works without errors
- ✅ `yarn run cmd qa --help` shows proper help aligned with WorkPlan
- ✅ CLI integration maintained
- ✅ No broken references remain in codebase
- ✅ System ready for new implementation

## Status
**Ready for development team to begin implementation of Release 0.1.0 according to WorkPlan QA CLI.md**
