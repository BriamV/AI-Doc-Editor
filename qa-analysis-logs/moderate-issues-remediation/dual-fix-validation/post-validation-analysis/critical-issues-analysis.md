# Critical Issues Analysis - RF-003 Validation FAILED

## Evidence-Based Analysis - NO SPECULATION

### Issue 1: Tool Detection Fallback BROKEN ‚ùå

**Evidence**:
- Log l√≠neas 34-35: `üî∂ black: not available` y `üî∂ pylint: not available`
- System check: `which black` ‚Üí `/c/Users/User/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python311/Scripts/black`
- System check: `which pylint` ‚Üí NOT FOUND

**Problem**: 
- black IS available in system PATH but ToolChecker doesn't detect it
- My fallback logic is NOT working
- pylint genuinely not available (expected behavior)

### Issue 2: MegaLinter Coverage INCOMPLETE ‚ùå

**Evidence from Validation Log**:
- ‚úÖ CSS violations: coverage/base.css, coverage/lcov-report/base.css
- ‚úÖ Python violations: backend/**/*.py files
- ‚úÖ Markdown violations: docs/**/*.md files  
- ‚ùå JavaScript violations: MISSING - no scripts/**/*.cjs files shown
- ‚ùå HTML violations: MISSING - no coverage/**/*.html files shown
- ‚ùå YAML violations: NOT in main output (only in separate log)

**Modified Files NOT Processed**:
```
scripts/qa/core/EnvironmentChecker.cjs     ‚Üê Should show ESLint violations
scripts/qa/core/Orchestrator.cjs           ‚Üê Should show ESLint violations
scripts/qa/core/PlanSelector.cjs           ‚Üê Should show ESLint violations
[...20+ more .cjs files]                   ‚Üê All missing from output
```

### Issue 3: Parser Implementation GAPS ‚ùå

**Strategy Pattern Status**:
- ‚úÖ CSS Parser: Working (evidence: CSS violations displayed)
- ‚úÖ Generic Parser: Working (evidence: Python/Markdown violations)
- ‚ùå JavaScript Parser: NOT implemented or not working
- ‚ùå HTML Parser: NOT implemented or not working  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è YAML Parser: Working but violations not in main output

## Root Cause Investigation Required

### Priority 1: Fix ToolChecker Fallback
- Debug why black detection fails despite being in PATH
- Check venv vs system PATH resolution logic
- Test fallback mechanism specifically

### Priority 2: Complete MegaLinter Parser Coverage
- Investigate why JavaScript/HTML parsers don't work
- Check if MegaLinter is actually running those linters
- Verify parser implementation for missing file types

### Priority 3: Verify Branch Filtering
- Check if fast mode is actually processing only modified files
- Verify VALIDATE_ONLY_CHANGED_FILES is working correctly

## Status: VALIDATION FAILED ‚ùå

Multiple critical issues persist. Cannot declare success until:
1. Tool detection fallback works for available tools
2. All file types show violations when present
3. Complete coverage per PRD RF-004 specifications
