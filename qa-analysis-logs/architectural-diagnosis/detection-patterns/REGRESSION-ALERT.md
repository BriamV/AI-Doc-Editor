# REGRESIÓN CRÍTICA DETECTADA - TODAS LAS HERRAMIENTAS FALLAN

**Timestamp**: 2025-07-18 19:50:00
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Status**: 100% tool detection failure vs previous partial failures

## CURRENT STATE (3 baseline runs)

### Tools Failing Consistently (100% failure rate)
- ❌ **megalinter**: not available (100% of runs)
- ❌ **eslint**: not available (100% of runs) 
- ❌ **black**: not available (100% of runs)
- ❌ **pylint**: not available (100% of runs)
- ❌ **pip**: not available (100% of runs)

## COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS STATES

### Previous State (moderate-issues-remediation logs)
- megalinter: 33% success (1/3 runs successful)
- eslint: 100% detection, inconsistent execution
- black/pylint: Intermittent failures

### Current State (architectural-diagnosis baseline)
- **ALL TOOLS**: 100% failure rate
- **COMPLETE SYSTEM BREAKDOWN**

## ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS

**Most Likely**: Recent changes in `refactor/qa-code-quality` branch have introduced:
1. **Environment corruption**: Virtual environment detection breaking all commands
2. **Path corruption**: npm/system commands not executing properly  
3. **Timeout issues**: All commands timing out before completion
4. **Permission issues**: Commands failing due to access problems

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Forensic Analysis Needed
1. **Check environment state changes**
2. **Analyze recent commits impact**
3. **Identify specific component causing universal failure**
4. **Emergency rollback strategy if needed**

### Investigation Priority
1. **VenvManager state**: Is venv activation corrupting all commands?
2. **ToolChecker modifications**: Did recent changes break basic execution?
3. **EnvironmentChecker configuration**: Are tool definitions corrupted?

This represents a **complete system failure** requiring immediate investigation and potentially emergency rollback.
