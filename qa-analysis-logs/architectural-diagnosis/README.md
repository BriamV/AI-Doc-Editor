# ARCHITECTURAL DIAGNOSIS - QA SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT INCONSISTENCIES

**Date**: 2025-07-18
**Branch**: refactor/qa-code-quality
**Problem**: Architecture flaw causing tool detection inconsistencies between VenvManager, NPM commands, and system tools

## DIAGNOSIS PHASES

### Phase 1: Forensic Diagnosis (ACTIVE)
- **environment-matrix/**: Testing across different environment states
- **detection-patterns/**: Tool detection behavior analysis  
- **correlation-analysis/**: Environment vs detection correlation
- **current-state/**: Baseline analysis of current implementation

### Phase 2: Architectural Fixes
- Environment context isolation
- Command execution coordination
- Detection cache synchronization

### Phase 3: Validation
- Consistency target validation against fixed-environment-consistency.log
- Performance regression checks
- 100% consistency verification

### Phase 4: Documentation
- Complete audit trail
- Before/after analysis
- Architecture decision records

## BASELINE COMPARISON

**Target State**: qa-analysis-logs/issues-remediation/post-fix-validation/fixed-environment-consistency.log
- 100% consistent detection from first execution
- No detection/execution mismatches
- Predictable behavior across all tools

**Current State**: Inconsistent detection patterns
- MegaLinter: 33% success rate
- Python tools: Failing in venv context
- NPM commands: Interfering with venv activation
